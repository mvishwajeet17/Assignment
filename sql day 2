To calculate the average price of the products sold, you need to add up the prices of all the products and then divide by the total number of products. Let's do the calculation:

Total price = 10.00 + 15.50 + 8.75 + 20.25 + 12.00 = 66.50

Total number of products = 5

Average price = Total price / Total number of products = 66.50 / 5 = 13.30

The average price of the products sold is $13.30.
